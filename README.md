## Weather Dashboard

I created a weather dashboard with the openweathermap API. On my webpage when you search for a city you will be presented with the current temperature, wind and humidity for that day, along with a small image weather icon. You will also be presented with the temperature, wind and humidity forcast for the next five days. If the user has already searched for a city their search will be saved thier local storage and will appear when they begin to type that same city into the search bar. This is a great webpage for anyone going on a trip and need a quick and easy way to view the weather forcast for the city they are traveling to.
